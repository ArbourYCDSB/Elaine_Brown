At her birth, she was greeted by her parents, Dorothy Brown and Horace Scott. She was raised by her single mother because her father never publicly acknowledged Elaine. Brown and her mother lived in a poor neighbourhood that was not well maintained.  She was an only child. Her mother worked in a dress factory and her father was a prominent member of Philadelphia’s black middle class. She had many rich white friends. After some time, Brown began to talk and act like them.

After her mother fought endlessly, Elaine was enrolled at the Thaddeus Stevens School of Practice. Elaine Brown always wanted to experience many different things in her life but more specifically, she loved to learn in different ways. For this reason, Elaine attended many different schools. She attended Mills College, Philadelphia High School For Girls, University of California, Los Angeles, Southwestern Law School and Temple University. After she completed her education, she became a singer, politician and writer.

        	<h2 class="h2">A Brave Decision</h2>
         	<p id="who" style="margin: 3px">When Brown finished High School, she barely had any money. She decided to get a job at a Nightclub. There, she met Jay Kennedy. He was  an accomplished writer, a social activist, and a member of the Communist party. In addition, he followed Martin Luther King Jr. Kennedy was very important in Elaine’s life because he was the first to influence the development of Brown’s social conscience which led to the creation of the Black Panther Party. When Elaine reached her middle-age years, Elaine had an idea to either create or become a member of a black militant group. She was driven by her vision of Civil Rights for everyone.</p>
      	<p id="who">Brown began writing for the radical Black Congress Newspaper, Harambee. But, she was so driven by the idea of helping society in reaching equality that she had decided to join a black militant group called the Black Panther Party. Originally, this group was formed to defend themselves from aggressive and violent white people. After a while, the founder of the group, Huey P. Newton decided that the Black Panther Party should start to defend other African Americans from abusive white people, including a  17 year old prostitute who was sentenced to Cuba to be killed. Instead of sending the young 17 year old girl, Huey P. Newton decided to sacrifice himself. Before Huey left, he decided to give the responsibility of the Black Panthers to Elaine. Some time later, she became the head Chairwoman of the Black Panther Party. Sadly when Newton returned in 1977, Elaine Brown left the Party due to an increasing hostility within the party towards its female leadership.</p>

   <h2 class="h2">Accomplishments</h2>
    	<p id="acc">Elaine Brown became the Chairwoman of a black militant group, the Blank Panthers, that fought against the segregation of African Americans. She is respected today because she is known to be one of the reasons why African Americans are so liberal today. Also, she recorded two albums with Horace Tapscott. Alongside her musical abilities, she was a talented author. Elaine became an author of many inspiring books such as “ A Taste of Power” and “ The Condemnation of Little B.” She ran for City Council twice in her lifetime. First in 1973 and for the second time in 1975. She wasn’t elected either of those times, but she succeeded in increasing her fellowship and influence. In 1996 Brown moved to Atlanta, Georgia where she established Field of Flowers, a nonprofit organization designed to build a model education center for impoverished children.  Brown also co-founded two other organizations, Mothers Advocating Juvenile Justice (1997) and the National Alliance for Radical Prison Reform (2002).  In March of 2007 Elaine Brown announced her candidacy for the Green Party nomination for President of the United States. In addition, Elaine Brown had a daughter named Ericka Abram.</p>

        	<td id="who" width="60%" style="border: 5px solid pink">Elaine Brown was a very interesting character to research because she was a very courageous woman. She fought against segregation for many years and overcame any hate that came her way. She ran for a position at City Council and lost. But instead of giving up, she tried to run again. This shows great compassion for equality in her country. She did her work in a nonviolent way and still greatly impacted her country. Brown was a brave and independent woman for being Chairwoman at the Black Panther Party. She didn’t listen to negative opinions going about in the militant group because she knew that what she was doing was right.  Throughout her entire career, she remained focused on achieving her goal of equality.

     	<p id="who">Elaine Brown is alive to this day. She now lives in Oakland, California. She is currently 75 years old and is in good health. She was very important in the Civil Rights movement because she was Chairwoman of the black militant group, the Black Panther Party. This organization protested in a much more violent and aggressive way. They fought to establish revolutionary socialism through mass organization and community based programs. If Elaine never joined the fight to end segregation, African Americans wouldn’t have the freedom they do today. Also, since she ran for a position on the City Council, she was able to share her opinions on segregation. The first time she ran for this position, she talked about how segregation should be banned. The second time she ran, she had 44% of the votes because people understood her cause. She will be remembered because she fought against racism and sexism. Not only did Brown fight to end segregation, but she fought against sexism by being the leader of an organization full of men. </p>

       	<p id="who">She was the leader of a revolutionary organization. Usually women were overpowered by men, but Elaine Brown worked hard and proved them wrong. Many women still experience these same struggles today.  Brown was seen as an underdog, but took a great leap to follow what she believes in no matter the cost. People probably didn’t expect her to be as successful as she was because during that time period, black people were looked down upon. I was really fascinated by how she ran for a position at City Council twice. She lost the first time, but came back a second to share her opinions on segregation. After all her work, she helped society a lot by contributing to ending segregation. I love how she did her work in a non violent manner. She has influenced my life because she showed courage, persistence and how women can change the world. This is very influential for me because her story shows us how following your dreams leads to greatness.</p>
